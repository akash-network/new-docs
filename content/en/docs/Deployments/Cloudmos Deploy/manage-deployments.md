There are a several important management operations you can do with the Cloudmos Deploy tool including:

* [Add funds to existing deployment’s Escrow Account](manage-deployments.md#add-funding-to-active-deployment)
* [Close an active deployment](manage-deployments.md#close-active-deployment)

### **Deployment Dashboard Overview**

* To get an overview of what you have deployed click the `Dashboard` button on the left hand navigation pane
* From the Active Deployments window you can see the resources that are dedicated to each deployment.

### **Add Funding to Active Deployment**

* If your escrow for a deployment is running low you will need to add some funds.
* Within the `Dashboard` pane, isolate the deployment of interest, select the `...` option to expand options, and select `Deposit`

* A dialog box will pop up allowing you to add tokens to the deployment’s escrow account
* Select the `DEPOSIT` button once you have put in the correct amount
* As always you must confirm the gas fees and transaction to the blockchain by clicking “APPROVE”
